SwitchButton
============
This project is one of my attempts of view customizing. It's simple and not that easy to use ---- maybe you need to copy that .java file to your project and do some code things in that, to style the button.

The button may looks like this:

![ON status](http://blog.kyleduo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/switchbutton_on.jpg)

And off status:

![ON status](http://blog.kyleduo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/switchbutton_off.png)

What I have done are:

-   Built the struct of switch button, what you need is only to change the image source.
-   Gave some suggestion of how much dimension to use.
-   Animate this button.(Maybe not the best practice, but it works.)
-   Made a demo with cute image source. ^.^

Wish any of suggestions from you, anything will be help.
