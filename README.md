After a few days before, I have updated this project completely. To finish this work, I refer to the project of [@Issacw0ng](https://github.com/Issacw0ng/SwitchButton), to learn how to control the animation and response to UI and did some update under my understand.

Now, SwitchButton can used more easily to present a switch of flat style using color. The default looking is like this:

To offer a convient way to configuration the looking, I designed a series of interface. You can use them to change the style. In demo, you can find how to use them. The demo looks like this:
